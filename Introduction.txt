My name is Wisane Manthosi, and I live in Pretoria, Gauteng with my big sister and little sister. I enjoy spending time with my family and cherish the moments we share together.

I love to read, eat, and spend time with myself. These hobbies allow me to relax, learn new things, and reflect on my thoughts. I am always eager to explore new experiences and continue growing personally and intellectually.
